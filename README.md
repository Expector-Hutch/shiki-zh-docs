English | [简体中文](https://github.com/ifshizuku/shiki-zh-docs/blob/main/README_ZH.md)

> Currently, the translation of this document is done by Shizuku only, and it is synchronized with the official document two to three times a week. In the meantime, we are working on a better synchronization CLI, which will make it easier to translate the document. Contribution guidelines will be written some time later, and in the meantime, you can contribute directly to this repository by initiating PRs.
